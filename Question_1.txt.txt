If I had to choose my all time favorite editor it would be Notepad++. That being said I do not have extensive experiences with many editors but if I was forced to choose one it would be Notepad++. The three main reasons are listed below:

1. Notepad++ is a very small application which does not cause much trouble and that does not use up much space. There are many editors out there which require up to 500 megabytes worth of storage space. There are also many editors out there which require you to do things like redefine path variables or set up workspaces. One such editor is eclipse, which is a very popular ide, and I understand why it takes up so much space and is so much trouble. Eclipse has many features that make up for the previously mentioned negatives but these features may not be necessary to everyone. Notepad++ is a small application that can run virtually anyway and does not really intrude upon your system. It is easy to setup, quick to run, and does not have any noticeable impact on your system.

2. Notepad++ is very versatile mainly because it is a general editor. As mentioned in the video a general editor is one that is not specialized for any specific language which may mean that it lacks some features of specialized editors but it also means it can be used for many purposes. I used Notepad++ to write Javascript, HTML, CSS, C++, and Java. This utility is not even restricted to programming languages. I can use Notepad++to open, and edit virtually any file. I sometimes even use Notepad++ instead of the normal Notepad because it is just so versatile.

3. Notepad++ is easy to use. When I say that I mean that it is very intuitive and simple. I believe that anyone could one day have Notepad replaced with Notepad++ and not be bothered because it is so simple. When I first used an ide like Eclipse I needed some explanation on how to do things but with Notepad++ everything was very intuitive.

Those are the reasons I would choose Notepad++ as my favorite editor.
